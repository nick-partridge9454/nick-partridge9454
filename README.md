Hello anyone and everyone!

 I'm Nick, a Non-Binary person with They/Them pronouns, and I'm starting my journey to become a full-stack software developer. Here is a quick little overview about me so you have a better idea of what I'm all about.

I currently 27 and I've been living in Dayton, OH my whole life. The last few years have been spent in several different fields to try and figure out a meaningful career trajectory. I've been a librarian, warehouse cog, contract electritian, construction laboror, and a few other things. So far I've only learned what I don't want to do, until recently. 

Thanks to the helpful suggestions of close friends I became aware of and grew an interest in software development, which has lead me to enroll in a coding bootcamp so I can aquire the skills and experience necessary to break into the tech field. I'm not yet sure what specialization I'd like to focus on as of now, but nevertheless the knowledge on my horizon will prove nothing but helpful as I figure things out.

I look forward to becoming a valuable asset with plenty of skills at my disposal. Thanks for having me!
